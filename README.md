## Your canteen in Karlsruhe isn't supported?

Make sure that your canteen is available in the [OpenMensa](https://openmensa.org) database. 

If your canteen is not currently included in the [OpenMensa](https://openmensa.org) database, you can learn more about how to make your canteen available in the database [here](https://openmensa.org/contribute). 

Then you can open a pull request and add the canteen at the appropriate place in the code.
